# GUESS-GAME
```
This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Go. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has 10 attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct.
```
## How to Play
```
1. Run the program.
2. The program will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 100.
3. Enter your guess and press Enter.
4. The program will tell you if your guess is too low, too high, or correct.
5. You have 10 attempts to guess the correct number.
6. If you guess correctly, the program will congratulate you. If you run out of attempts, the program will reveal the correct number.
